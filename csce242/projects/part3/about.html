            <h2>Our Founding Story</h2>
            <p>
                VitalFit & Wellness was founded in 2010 by three fitness enthusiasts who shared a common goal: to create a space 
                where people of all backgrounds could come together to focus on their well-being. What started as a small community 
                fitness class in a local park has grown into a wellness movement. With a passion for both physical and mental health, 
                the founders aimed to create a center that offered not only fitness programs but also holistic wellness coaching 
                and nutritional support. Their vision was simple: build a supportive community where people can achieve their best health.
