            We have five divisions in our graphic, and inside each of those sections, specific topics are covered.
            The format section primarily describes how it should be set up in specific situations. The government
             funding section is the other When the government will support and participate in particular projects.
              Anything a person must accomplish or acquire outside of work is considered to be in the outside of work
               area. Anything related to work or specific aspects of the workplace are covered in the work environment
                section. Everything that affects location is covered in the location section.

            I used my character, Jade, in the scenario. Where Jade is employed and received payment for the week. After that,
            she had enough money to purchase a car. She had enough money, but she had no idea where she could find one
            for a reasonable price. She then opened the app that assists those who are homeless in finding cheap cars,
            homes, etc. She then utilized the app to find the desired car. Later, she went to the seller and paid for the car.

        <p>
          The first sketch shows most of the app's features and runs through what it can do, such as find housing, jobs, sell cars, and more.
           The key thing about the second sketch is that it shows how the user applies for a job and a place to live. As you can see in the last
            sketch, our app has a sales section. The user wanted to buy a car so the sketch shows how to get the car.

        <p>
            Our app starts by explaining how to log in or create an account in order to use it. When you sign up, you'll be asked to enter certain details, etc.
             Following that, the application will prompt the user to indicate their search terms and desired level of proximity to the location.
             After that, the user will be taken to the options they have chosen. our vehicles, housing, education, and job listings.
             A few open jobs will be visible to the user if they choose the job listings tab. When a user applies for a job, they submit an application.
             A few days later, the user receives a notification in the app indicating whether or not their application was accepted.
             The user will see available vehicles if they choose the vehicles tab. The user will see housing options and the application
             to apply for it if they choose housing. The user will see community and technical colleges if they choose the education option.

        <p>
          The home screen of our Hi-Fi prototype initially has the two primary buttons—the next and back buttons.
           The features of what this app has to offer are listed on the next page that appears when you click the next button.
            Which covered housing, jobs, cars, and education, with the emphasis being on finding a car.
             The Nissan Versa car was chosen from the list of cars on the following page.
              The price was listed on the following page, which required several confirmations, and the pickup location—Target—was selected after that.
               Next, a time and date had to be chosen, so we chose Saturday at 10:00 am out of the available options.
                The back button was used several times to go back in our Hi-Fi Prototype, and selections that were selected were marked with checkmarks to confirm.
                 An order confirmation appeared on the following page.
                  The final page then included a feature that allowed you to select what you were looking for by going back into the sections.
