                    We have five divisions in our graphic, and inside each of those sections, specific topics are covered.
                     The format section primarily describes how it should be set up in specific situations. The government
                      funding section is the other When the government will support and participate in particular projects.
                       Anything a person must accomplish or acquire outside of work is considered to be in the outside of work
                        area. Anything related to work or specific aspects of the workplace are covered in the work environment
                         section. Everything that affects location is covered in the location section.

                <p>
               Helping homeless individuals and ex-convicts find employment is a challenge that requires time and resources from employers and the government.
