            We have five divisions in our graphic, and inside each of those sections, specific topics are covered.
            The format section primarily describes how it should be set up in specific situations. The government
             funding section is the other When the government will support and participate in particular projects.
              Anything a person must accomplish or acquire outside of work is considered to be in the outside of work
               area. Anything related to work or specific aspects of the workplace are covered in the work environment
                section. Everything that affects location is covered in the location section.

            I used my character, Jade, in the scenario. Where Jade is employed and received payment for the week. After that,
            she had enough money to purchase a car. She had enough money, but she had no idea where she could find one
            for a reasonable price. She then opened the app that assists those who are homeless in finding cheap cars,
            homes, etc. She then utilized the app to find the desired car. Later, she went to the seller and paid for the car.
